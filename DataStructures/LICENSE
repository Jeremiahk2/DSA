Much of the code required for CSC316 workshop coding activities is provided
by the textbook authors. Some workshops will also require additional code
that is not provided by the textbook authors, and the teaching staff may have
modified the behaviors or structure/pacakges of some of the provided code.
You are not required to use the code provided by the textbook authors, but it is
strongly encouraged to review the code provided by the textbook authors to
help with debugging. 

If a student wishes to include this DataStructures project as part of a coding
portfolio or resume materials, the student must clearly indicate what portions
of the codebase were original (created by the student), which portions of the
codebase were provided by the textbook authors (cited in class-level Javadoc for
each relevant class), and which portions of the codebase were provided by other
students (cited in class-level Javadoc for each relevant class).
