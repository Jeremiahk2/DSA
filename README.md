## Data Structures
This is a collection of  various repos that I worked on during my Data Structures & Algorithms class. I'm preserving it here on this github for when my school acoount gets deleted.
I also took the liberty of importing the entire commit history of all twelve repos here so that it's clear what I did and what the teaching staff did.

Overall, this project includes a Java implementation of the following data structures and algorithms:
